# Cloudflare Worker Proxy

This Cloudflare Worker acts as a proxy to dynamically fetch and display content from a specified website within the worker's domain.

## Features

- **Proxy Functionality**: Fetches content from a target website and displays it within the worker.
- **URL Rewriting**: Rewrites URLs in the fetched content to ensure they point correctly to the worker's domain.
- **CORS Support**: Adds CORS headers to allow cross-origin requests.

## Setup

1. **Cloudflare Account**:
   - Ensure you have a Cloudflare account set up.

2. **Cloudflare Workers**:
   - Go to the Cloudflare dashboard and navigate to Workers.

3. **Create a New Worker**:
   - Create a new worker and paste the provided script.

4. **Configuration**:
   - Open the script and replace `'example.com'` with the domain of the website you want to proxy. This should be done in the following line:
     ```javascript
     const targetHost = 'example.com'; // Replace with the target website
     ```

5. **Deploy**:
   - Save and deploy your worker.

## Usage

- Access your Cloudflare Worker URL to see the proxied content of the target website.

## Security Considerations

- Respect the terms of service and usage policies of the target website.
